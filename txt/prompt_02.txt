so for rating, condition, contruction grade etc, user can enter a number (with different ranges).
I would like for the user to use dropdowns instead. 
can you create dropdowns for me? (use your imagination to give some value to every actual number).
Also the "Generate Price Estimate" text is too small, can i be bigger.
